                My favourite thing about PHP so far is that you can utilise the back-end capabilities to automate a lot of the page building; 
                this means that when building a website you can really cut down on the amount of code actually written. <br><br>
                Using PHP's 'include' and 'require' commands (depending on how important the file is for the page), you can include anything from an 
                array to an entire page in your page by saving it as it's own file, and include it as many times as you want. <br><br>
                For this website, the header and footer are their own php files and so is each section and page of the site.

                    By having each section as it's own PHP file, the project index page is able to be extremely simple as just a sequence of include and require statements. <br><br>
                    This makes changing the layout of the homepage as simple as moving one line of code and any uncompleted segments (like my blogs section in this example) 
                    can still be positioned and included as commented out lines, ready to be quickly and easily included when ready.
