                    I'm currently saving up to buy a good laptop but the one I'm currently working on is a Â£250 cloudbook so, as you can imagine, it does not have much processing power and can't handle much more than the standard functionality of a laptop. 
                    As I've recently been hired as a remote project engineer, I quickly hit that wall while attempting to set up the requirements for a machine learning project (wishful thinking, I know). 
                    Though I'm a Windows user, I learnt to code on an Ubuntu WSL and had also learnt about cloud computing on that same course, so decided to put my training to use and used <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" title="Microsoft Azure: Cloud Computing Services" alt="Link to Microsoft Azure's website">Microsoft Azure</a> to create a cloud based Linux virtual machine.
                    I chose Azure simply because I saw a step by step of how to set a VM up with VSCode with them and it looked pretty straightforwards.
                    I'd only used AWS before so it took a small adjustment period and to understand the different terms for things, different arrangements etc and I did end up saving all the files externally and making a new VM some time after getting it running to use better specs, 
                    but overall I found Azure very straightforward to navigate and understand and to be able to see what needed to be upgraded to achieve what you want to do.

            The majority of the buttons I added to the sheet were for ease of navigation; they give the user a quick way to jump to any specific week number, this current week or back to the input (home) page. 
            These were all pretty simple to code as they just required a function to 'activate' the sheet by it's name (e.g. Input or 1 for week 1).
